== Description ==
[shareThat Site Traffic Builder](http://www.sharethat.com) makes it easy for you to integrate highly engaging social promotions into your site marketing strategy. 

The plug in is extremely easy to use and very effective at driving free social traffic back to your site. Site visitors engage in gameified promotions including spin to win *(like "Wheel of Fortune" only better!)*, word search, memory match, and picture scramble games. When visitors complete games, they are encouraged to share the promotion on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. As a reward, they are entered into a monthly $100 drawing *(paid for by shareThat)*.

**Features**:

* **Promotions that Engage** A growing list of promotion types includes spin to win, word search, memory match, and picture scramble.

* **FREE Social Traffic** Hundreds of user generated shares and posts lead social traffic back to your site.

* **Page Magnet** technology leads social visitors back to whatever site page a social share was originally created on.

* **Fully Customizable** All colors, images and text displayed by the promotions can be fully customized to meet your marketing goals and match your site theme.

* **Reward Your Visitors** Offer your visitors a chance to win $100 Amex gift card each month at no cost to you.

* **Sidebar Widget** Displays as an image in a widget placed in a sidebar or other widget container. When clicked, the promotion is popped up in a lightbox without navigating to a different page.

* **Shortcode Support** Include promotions in posts using shortcodes.

* **Statistics** View detailed stats telling you exactly what is going on with your promotions.\*

* **Leads** Turn anonymous traffic into valuable leads. Download the email addresses of promotion participants to build your email marketing strategy.\*

* **Deep Site Engagement** Drive deeper site engagement using interstitials displayed to participants between game play that click through to pages you want to promote.\*

\* *This feature requires a paid upgrade subscription.*

You can add the Site Traffic Builder promotions inside your posts using a shortcode:

* `[sharethat]` - adds the fully interactive promotion 600 pixels wide.
* `[sharethat_widget]` - adds the promotion as an image that when clicked will pop up the fully interactive promotion on a lightbox.
